My Master of Science data analysis and spatial rendering

The scripts are fairly self explanatory. The first one creates maps and spreadsheets of data for invasive plants (more focussed on <i>C. stoebe</i>) in the Lac Du Bois Grasslands Protected Area, as well as throughout BC. Note that any processing of province wide data takes quite a while (~6 hours on a computer with a 4-core processor), but any of the local or Lac Du Bois focussed scripts are fairly quick. Additionally, there is a file containing for the GPS location of my study area in that park. 

The second script focusses on the obtained greenhouse data, specifically biomass and survival of potted individuals. All of the code used to generate the plots used in my MSc will also be located in there. 

The third script focusses on the field surveys between invaded and pristine sites. This mostly includes plant survey data, diversity and richness data, as well as ground temperature data and associated plots. I did not create plots for bare ground and litter surveys since I don't think that adds much to a discussion. 

Finally, the fourth script deals with the field experiment that was poorly executed. Some graphs and data will be added for that script later on.

The .gitignore file will allow for files in any data subfolder to be uploaded, and all of the data used for R processing has been incldued in this repository.
